      "question": "Is Orion Store safe?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Orion Store is completely open-source. This means our code is public on GitHub for anyone to audit. We believe in transparency—no hidden trackers, no data mining, just a clean gateway to apps.",
      "icon": "fa-shield-cat"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are apps on Orion safe?",
      "answer": "Yes. I personally review and mod them using tools available on their official repositories to ensure they are safe, functional, and privacy-respecting before they land here.",
      "icon": "fa-check-double"
    },
    {
     "question": "Are ReVanced builds safe?",
     "answer": "Yes. These builds are automated via GitHub Actions bots, not manually patched. They use the official ReVanced CLI and patches on APKs sourced from APKMirror, Uptodown, and APKPure. The process runs daily at 6 AM. The entire build pipeline is transparent and open-source: https://github.com/RookieEnough/Revanced-AutoBuilds",

  {
    "question": "Installation failed?",
    "answer": "If you see 'App not installed' or 'Package conflicts', it's likely a signature mismatch. You cannot install a modded app over the original Play Store version or a different mod. Uninstall the existing app first, then install the one from Orion.",

  },
    {
      "question": "Download not working?",
      "answer": "Don't panic! Just head to the app's detail page and click the 'Report' icon (⚠️) in the top right corner. It will pre-fill an email so I can fix it ASAP.",
      "icon": "fa-bug"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will there be more apps?",
      "answer": "Yes, if there'll be more interesting apps to add on. As long as I find open-source or useful tools that deserve a spotlight, the library will keep growing.",

    {
      "question": "How can I support?",
